# üïµÔ∏è Fake News Detector App

This is an end-to-end data science project that demonstrates the entire workflow of building and deploying a machine learning application. It uses a Deep Learning model to classify a given news article as either **REAL** or **FAKE**. The model is trained on a public dataset and then deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and tokenizes raw text data.
* **Class Balancing:** Addresses imbalanced data to prevent model bias.
* **Interactive UI:** A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Python:** The core programming language.
* **TensorFlow/Keras:** For building and training the deep learning model.
* **Pandas & NumPy:** For data manipulation.
* **scikit-learn:** For data splitting and evaluation.
* **NLTK:** For natural language processing tasks.
* **Streamlit:** For creating the web application UI.
